<h1 style="text-align:center;">Brief Thoughts from a Disappointed Patriots Fan</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Overall Thoughts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Our defense played well and are the reason we stayed in the game for as long as we did.</li>
<li>Our offense was not able to score and could not connect with the opportunities were there.</li>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Some Context</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"> On the evening of February 8th, 2026, the New England Patriots played the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX. Sadly, the Patriots lost, 29-13. Patriots did not score a point until the fourth quarter of the game.

</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Where did we go wrong?</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Patriots offense struggled in a few different areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>The offensive line was not effective at blocking for the quarterback or running backs.</li>
<li>Our quarterback did not make decisions quick enough.</li>
<li>Our quarterback’s throws were off-target at key moments.</li>
<li>The opposing team’s punter pinned our offense within the 10 yard line multiple times, giving us a tough starting position.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Where did we go right?</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Patriots defense, despite no takeaways and no defensive scores, kept us in the game for quite a while. Here are a few things they did right: </p>
<ul>
<li>Christian Gonzalez did an exceptional job covering some of the best receivers in the league.</li>
<li>Overall, our pass and rush defense were good, and only a few big runs were allowed.</li>
<li>The Seahawks were help to field goals for most of the game.</li>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">While our performance was disappointing, it could have been worse. Ultimately we were able to scored some points (even if it was too late). Overall, this team significantly outperformed expectations, considering that we had two extremely bad seasons before this, our head coach is in his first year, and we have a lot of young players. Even though I’m sad now, we had an impressive season, and hopefully next season is fun to watch as well. </p>
