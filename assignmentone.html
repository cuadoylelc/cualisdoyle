<h1>An Overview of the D.C. Public Library Information System</h1>
<h2>Institution History</h2>
<p>The D.C. Public Library was created in 1896 by an act of Congress, and its creation is credited to the efforts of Theodore W. Noyes, a journalist and editor of the Evening Star newspaper. For its first few years, the library was located in a house on New York Ave NW while a Central Library was built (paid for by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie) in Mount Vernon Square. The central library of the system was located in Mount Vernon Square from 1903 to 1972, when it was replaced with the newly built Martin Luthor King Jr. Memorial Library in Chinatown. The first branch of the library was built in 1911 in Takoma Park. There are currently 25 neighborhood branches of the DCPL.

<h2>DCPL Users</h2>
<p>The DCPL’s primary purpose is to serve DC communities by providing access and knowledge within a supportive environment. Read more about their purpose statement and its genesis <a href=“https://www.dclibrary.org/about-us/dc-public-library-culture”>here</a>. Therefore, their targeted user is a resident of D.C. who is seeking out library services and events. The library offers a range of services, and users may have various priorities or preferences when interacting with these services. Below is an explanation of the three main motivations of users of the DCPL system. Please note that, while these are presented as three separate approaches, a single user may have a combination of motivations when accessing the DCPL information system on any given day.</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Space Seeker: </b></i>Some users are interested in the library as a physical location, so they use the library’s website to reserve a meeting or study room, or check library branch hours.</li>
<li><i><b>Audience Member: </b></i>Other users are interested in attending events or workshops that the DCPL offers. They use the library’s website to see what events are coming up, where and when they will be held, and what they will entail.</li>
<li><i><b>Resource Seeker: </b></i>Most of the users are seeking to borrow books, music, movies, and the other resources held in the library’s catalog. They use the library website to browse what is available, search for a specific item, and request access to that item.</li>
</ul>
<h2>System Content</h2>
<p>The DCPL’s system, as presented on their <a href=“https://www.dclibrary.org/“>website</a>, has two distinct buckets of information to analyze: event offerings and the library catalog.</p>
<h3>Event Offerings</h3>
<p>The website provides a variety of obvious and easily accessible access points within the navigation bar and the homepage that lead the user to event information. The user is provided with four ways to view library events:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scroll through the “Upcoming Events” list. Each list cell has an event title, a small representative image, a date and time, a location, and an age group specification. Clicking on the event title brings the user to an event-specific page which then provides an event description.</li>
<li>“Explore All Events” via a calendar view. Users can click on a specific date, which results in a list of events on that day. The listed events each specify event title, date and time, location, age group, event type keywords, and a brief description. Clicking on the event title brings the user to an event-specific page. Within the calendar view, users can additionally filter the events based on location, age group, or event type.</li>
<li>“Explore Upcoming Events by Audience” by selecting an age group from the following list of options: “Birth-5”; “5-12 Years Old”; “13-19 Years Old (Teens)”; “Adults”; “Seniors”. Clicking any of these options leads the user to the calendar page described in View #2, filtered by the selected age group.</li>
<li>“Explore Upcoming Events by Location” by selecting from an alphabetically ordered list of DCPL locations. Clicking any of these options leads the user to the calendar page described in View #2, filtered by the selected location.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these view options utilize hyperlinks to ultimately direct users to an event-specific page which lists all of the event information and registration links, if applicable. The four navigation options initially seem elaborate, but each view point is presenting the same batch of information while allowing the user to choose their preferred perspective (age group, date, location, etc.). This seems to be an effective use of time for those uploading events to the site. The uploader would not have to create a separate post for each of the different view points, but just one event-specific page. By filling out that page with their event title, description, date, location, age group, and keywords, the system can automatically position the event within the four view points using the uploaded metadata. This offers the best of both worlds: the uploader only has to create a single detailed web page, but the user has a variety of options for how to browse events.</p>
<h4>Room for Improvement</h4>
<p>While the event presentation is overall strong, I believe that the system could do more with event keywords. Keywords are visible in only one of the four event view points. They could easily be added to the "Upcoming Events” scroll, or could provide inspiration for a fifth event view point. Also, the system could utilize a more distinct visual language to distinguish between the numerous pieces of information that is presented with each event. For example, a specific color, font, or graphic could be used for the age group distinctions, drawing the user’s eye in and increasing cohesion amongst the various offered view points.</p>
<h3>Library Catalog</h3>
<p>If a user clicks on the “Find & Borrow” option in the menu at the top of DCPL’s website, they are brought to a search bar that allows them to “search the catalog.” If they click on the drop down menu to the right of the search bar, they are offered options of types of searches such as “All,” “Author,” “Subject,” “Series,” “Title.” If this is not satisfactory, they can click on “Advanced Search,” located right below the “search the catalog bar.”<br><br>Once they have conducted a search, the left hand menu offers options for further refinement. The user can filter by availability, format, language, age group, and more to narrow down their search. The returned catalog record includes: an image of the book cover, title, author, publication date, publisher, format options, available locations, age group, and options to “request any edition” or “find specific edition”. The record also specifies how many copies there are and if there are any holds on them at the moment by other patrons. If any of this information is unavailable or not applicable, it is omitted.</p>
<h4>Interesting Features</h4>
<p>The system has a couple of features that are particularly interesting or effective. One of these is the use of checkboxes in the returned record list. If the user clicks on multiple check boxes, they can place a hold on multiple resources at once. This is an extremely useful feature and is presented in a way that is extremely easy to use.<br><br>The system is also well designed visually. Availability information for each record is color coded (red for unavailable, green for available) and accompanied by a correspondingly-colored “X” or check mark. This makes it clear to the user which options are available or not even at a quick glance. Additionally, the list of records themselves is visually designed well. Each catalog record in the search return is within a box with rounded edges. The box has a light blue border on top and a grey border on bottom. This design helps distinguish between the different records in a way that is gentle and pleasing to the eye. It keeps the page from feeling overwhelmingly crowded with information.</p>
<h4>Room for Improvement</h4>
<p>One possible improvement could be a more dynamic design to the left hand menu. The left hand menu is in shades of grey, and the font size is slightly smaller than the font sizes in the search return records. Thus, it is easy for a user to not pay attention to it, especially when distracted by the variety of colors in the search return records themselves. This makes it less likely that users who are not actively seeking the filter restriction offered by the left hand menu will engage with it. The features offered by the left hand menu are extremely helpful, so visual design that brings the user’s attention to it would be an improvement.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, the DCPL website is a well designed information system that efficiently presents relevant information to its users. It accommodates the varying motivations of its users through the use of a persistent top menu and a home page that surveys the many types of information that the system holds. The system is particularly adept at offering a variety of view points for the user to choose from based on their own priorities or perspective. Each of these view points ultimately guide the user to centralized information, as discussed in the “Event Offerings” section above. The general search bar at the top of every page is another example of this: it appears to be a typical, simple search bar. However, once the user types their query into it, the returns page immediately offers them the option to filter the results by “Catalog,” “Website,” or “Events.” This model allows for a positive user experience and accommodates the diverse priorities that users approach the website with. It also presumably eases the burden on those who upload or maintain the system; since the view points lead to centralized information, they just need to upload information in a single, detailed place, and then the metadata takes care of populating it in the relevant locations on the site.</p>
